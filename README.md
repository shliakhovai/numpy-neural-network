# Simple Neural Network with NumPy

This project implements a basic neural network from scratch using NumPy. The network is trained to classify data generated from `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs`.

## Features

- Neural network with a single hidden layer
- Implementation of forward and backward propagation
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- IPython (for Jupyter notebooks)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numpy-neural-network.git
cd numpy-neural-network
